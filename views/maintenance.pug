			p As most of you know, with FFAS1, we lost our dear bot to SBMM. So I have made a fork of <a href="https://github.com/ShootMe/FallGuysStats">Shootme/FallGuysStats</a> and added optional data reporting, so YOU can help me gather the data that is displayed on this site. More info will come.  
			p Check in with our Twitter for updates. 
			p Much love ‚ù§ - The Fallalytics teams
